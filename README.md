# WITLOCK

WITLOCK is a proof-bound agreement and adjudication monolith for GenLayer StudioNet. It freezes weighted acceptance criteria, nominated external issuers, source provenance, deadlines, appeals, and an auditable decision history in one deployable `contracts/Witlock.py` contract.

The core path is:

`create_agreement` → `accept_agreement` → issuer `publish_attestation` → party `submit_evidence` → issuer `authenticate_evidence` → delivery/dispute → `seal_agreement` → GenLayer adjudication → appeal window → final decision.

Consensus returns only `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `INCONCLUSIVE` per criterion. Contract code validates the schema and computes the result and integer allocation. A digest proves bytes, and an issuer transaction proves wallet publication; neither proves factual truth by itself.

Native GEN custody is contained behind `custody_enabled() == False`. Non-zero funding, bonds, and payment calls are rejected until StudioNet transfer, recipient delivery, and recovery semantics are proven. Zero-value agreements remain available for the evidence and adjudication lifecycle.
